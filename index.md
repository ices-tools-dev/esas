The [**European Seabirds At Sea (ESAS)**](http://esas.ices.dk/) database assembles monitoring data on offshore seabirds and marine mammals, collected and/or managed by 18 European organizations. This international database mostly includes data from the North Sea (dating back to 1979), but large parts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean are covered as well. ESAS data are collected during at-sea surveys from a moving ship or aeroplane and according to a methodology that allows to calculate seabird densities. Standard practice further implies collecting as much information as possible on observation conditions, distance to the counted bird(s), age, plumage, behaviour and association with other marine wildlife and/or anthropogenic objects. 

This website describes the ESAS data model ("format"), which consists of 5 tables ("records") containing a number of fields.
