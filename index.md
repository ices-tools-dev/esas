The **European Seabirds At Sea (ESAS)** database assembles monitoring data on offshore seabirds and marine mammals, collected and/or managed by 18 European organizations. This international database mostly includes data from the North Sea (dating back to 1979), but large parts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean are covered as well. ESAS data are collected during at-sea surveys from a moving ship or aeroplane and according to a methodology that allows to calculate seabird densities. Standard practice further implies collecting as much information as possible on observation conditions, distance to the counted bird(s), age, plumage, behaviour and association with other marine wildlife and/or anthropogenic objects. 

The ESAS database finds its origin in the 'Seabirds at Sea' project that was initiated in 1979 following the discovery of major oil potential in the North Sea and an urgent need to gain knowledge on seabird occurrence and distribution in their offshore habitat. The first European-wide data assembly was performed in 1991 and for about three decades the resulting ESAS database was hosted by the UK-based Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). As part of the Dutch WOZEP research project, the database was migrated to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Data Centre in 2021. The aim of this particular project was a major update of the ESAS database and to make offshore seabird monitoring data more widely available.
