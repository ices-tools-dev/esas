title: Trips
description: >
  Lists all surveys (identified by a unique `tripkey`) and includes relevant 
  survey-specific parameters. Each record represents a single survey. If you 
  have multiple observers producing independent data streams, use a separate 
  `tripkey` for each of them (hence for the classical plane survey setup with 2 
  observers on each side of plane independently recording their observations, 
  there should be 2 unique `tripkey`s).
fields:
  - name: tripkey
    description: >
      Unique identifier for each trip record. Recommended practice is to use a 
      persistent identifier (i.e. one that does not change through time).
