title: Positions
description: >
  Positions during sampling. Since the platform moves during sampling, these positions often 
  represent the calculated middle point of a trajectory. These trajectories (called "observation 
  bins") typically have predefined durations (e.g. 2 minutes).

  - name: Beaufort
    description: |
      Sea state according to the Beaufort scale:
      - `0` Sea like mirror

      - `2` Small wavelets, crests of glassy appearance, not breaking
      - `3` Large wavelets, crests begin to break, scattered whitecaps
      - `4` Small waves becoming longer, numerous whitecaps
      - `5` Moderate waves, many whitecaps, some spray
      - `6` Larger waves, whitecaps everywhere, more spray
      - `7` Sea heaps up and white foam from breaking waves begins to be blown in streaks along the direction of the wind
      - `8` Moderately high waves; edges of crests begin to break into the spindrift; foam is blown in well-marked streaks along the direction of the wind
      - `9` High waves; dense streaks of foam along wind; crests begin to topple, tumble and roll over; spray may affect visibility
      - `10` Very high waves with long overhanging crests; foam in great patches blown in dense white streaks along wind; sea surface takes a white appearance; tumbling becomes heavy and shock-like; visibility affected
      - `11` Exceptionally high waves (medium sized ships may be lost to view behind waves); sea covered with long white patches of foam lying along the wind; everywhere edges of crests are blown into froth; visibility affected
      - `12` Air is filled with foam and spray; sea completely white with driving spray; visibility seriously affected
