title: Positions
description: >
  Lists all count positions (identified by a unique `poskey`) and includes 
  relevant position-specific parameters; has a many-to-one relationship with 
  the Trip data table and a one-to-many relationship with the Observations data 
  table. Each record represents an observation bin, characterised by a 
  position. Each position recorded during the survey is reported in the 
  Position table. For plane surveys this usually means a position for each 
  second of the survey. For ship-based surveys this usually means the 
  (calculated) middle point of the trajectory sailed during the observation bin.

      Unique identifier for each position record within a trip. Recommended 
      practice is to use a persistent identifier (i.e. one that does not change

      Sea state according to the Beaufort scale:

      - `4` Small waves becoming longer, numerous whitecaps
      - `5` Moderate waves, many whitecaps, some spray
      - `6` Larger waves, whitecaps everywhere, more spray
      - `7` Sea heaps up and white foam from breaking waves begins to be blown in streaks along the direction of the wind
      - `8` Moderately high waves; edges of crests begin to break into the spindrift; foam is blown in well-marked streaks along the direction of the wind
      - `9` High waves; dense streaks of foam along wind; crests begin to topple, tumble and roll over; spray may affect visibility
      - `10` Very high waves with long overhanging crests; foam in great patches blown in dense white streaks along wind; sea surface takes a white appearance; tumbling becomes heavy and shock-like; visibility affected
      - `11` Exceptionally high waves (medium sized ships may be lost to view behind waves); sea covered with long white patches of foam lying along the wind; everywhere edges of crests are blown into froth; visibility affected
      - `12` Air is filled with foam and spray; sea completely white with driving spray; visibility seriously affected
