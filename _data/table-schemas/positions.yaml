title: Positions
description: >
  Lists all count positions (identified by a unique `poskey`) and includes 
  relevant position-specific parameters; has a many-to-one relationship with 
  the Trip data table and a one-to-many relationship with the Observations data 
  table. Each record represents an observation bin, characterised by a 
  position. Each position recorded during the survey is reported in the 
  Position table. For plane surveys this usually means a position for each 
  second of the survey. For ship-based surveys this usually means the 
  (calculated) middle point of the trajectory sailed during the observation bin.

      Unique identifier for each position record within a trip. Recommended
