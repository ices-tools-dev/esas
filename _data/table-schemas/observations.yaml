description: > # TODO: species_key(?) number(?), Position(?) table
  Lists all bird or marine mammal records (identified by a unique `species_key` 
  number) and includes relevant observation-specific parameters; has a 
  many-to-one relationship with the Position data table; no entries should be 
  made for positions or observation bins without observations.
fields:

    description: > # TODO: add comments?
      Unique identifier for each observation within a trip. Recommended 
      practice is to use a persistent identifier (i.e. one that does not change 
      through time)

    description: | # TODO: add comments? Base_type? Trips table
      This is the distance at which the bird(s) or marine mammal(s) was/were 
      observed. Different distance bins are used for ship-based and aerial 
      surveys:

      For ship-based surveys (base_type = `1`):

      A standard 300 m transect is  assumed for marine mammals and birds in 
      contact with the water:
      - A In contact with the water, 0 - 50 m
      - B In contact with the water, 50 - 100 m
      - C In contact with the water, 100 - 200 m
      - D In contact with the water, 200 - 300 m
      - E In contact with the water, > 300 m, beyond strip transect
      - F Flying, no contact with water
      - U Unknown
      - W In contact with the water, but distance not recorded

      For any other type of distance bin classification in ship-based suryeys 
      or aerial surveys (base_type = `3`):

      Distance is indicated by the distance (m) to middle point of one the 
      distance bins specified in the `distance_bins` column in the Trips table; 
      observations outside this transect are indicated by a `>` sign 
      (e.g. `>1000`); unknown distance is indicated by `U`
