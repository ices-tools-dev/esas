title: Position
description: >
  Positions during sampling. Since the platform moves during sampling, these positions often 
  represent the calculated middle point of a trajectory. These trajectories (called "observation 
  bins") typically have predefined durations (e.g. 2 minutes).

  - name: WindForce
    description: |
      Wind force and sea state according to the Beaufort scale. Uses the [Beaufort](http://vocab.ices.dk/?ref=1705) vocabulary:
      - `0` Calm - Sea like mirror

      - `4` Moderate breeze - Small waves becoming longer, numerous whitecaps
      - `5` Fresh breeze - Moderate waves, many whitecaps, some spray
      - `6` Strong breeze - Larger waves, whitecaps everywhere, more spray
      - `7` High wind, moderate gale, near gale - Sea heaps up and white foam from breaking waves begins to be blown in streaks along the direction of the wind
      - `8` Gale, fresh gale - Moderately high waves; edges of crests begin to break into the spindrift; foam is blown in well-marked streaks along the direction of the wind
      - `9` Strong/severe gale - High waves; dense streaks of foam along wind; crests begin to topple, tumble and roll over; spray may affect visibility
      - `10` Storm, whole gale - Very high waves with long overhanging crests; foam in great patches blown in dense white streaks along wind; sea surface takes a white appearance; tumbling becomes heavy and shock-like; visibility affected
      - `11` Violent storm - Exceptionally high waves (medium sized ships may be lost to view behind waves); sea covered with long white patches of foam lying along the wind; everywhere edges of crests are blown into froth; visibility affected
      - `12` Hurricane force - Air is filled with foam and spray; sea completely white with driving spray; visibility seriously affected
